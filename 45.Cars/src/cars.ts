// Q No 45:
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
//It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
//such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

     manufacturer: manufacturer,
     model :model,
     ...Object.assign({}, ...rest)
    } 
    return car_obj
